<p><em>This post initially appeared on <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties">Science Blogs</a></em></p>
<p>This week, I&#39;m going to take a<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2010/11/saturday_review_oral_&#91;vaccines&#93;&#40;http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2010/11/vaccine_delivery_from_an_immun.php&#41;.php"> break</a> from vaccines and do some innate immunity. Today&#39;s topic: the provocatively named &quot;Inflammasome.&quot; <a href="http://goo.gl/efEoL">This Nature Review</a> from last month focused on inflammasomes and anti-viral immunity, but I think the inflammasome itself needs its own post.</p>
<p>A breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanisms that control the activation of inflammatory caspases came from the identification and characterization of the inflammasome, a large &#40;~700 kDa&#41; multiprotein complex that recruits inflammatory caspases and triggers their activation. Inflammasomes are often defined by their constituent PRR family member, which functions as a scaffold protein to bring caspase-1 molecules together and mediate proximity-induced auto-activation of caspase-1.  I&#39;m going to spend this entire post trying to explain that one paragraph. Let&#39;s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Note: the TL;DR version below</p>
<p>When immune cells like macrophages encounter bacteria and viruses they have a few typical responses, and one of the most important responses is the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine">Cytokines</a> are signaling proteins of the immune system; they are secreted by cells to communicate information to other cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines then, are cytokines that induce inflammation. There are a lot of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages, with names like tumor necrosis factor &#40;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha">TNF</a>&#41;, interleukin 1 and interleukin 6 &#40;IL-1 and IL-6&#41;. If a macrophage sees a bacterium, it will make TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 &#40;along with many others&#41;. If it sees viruses, it will make all the same cytokines &#40;and some others&#41;. But in order to study how this works, scientists started to use purified ligands to make things easier. If I want to study how a particular receptor &#40;like <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2010/11/immune_response_from_start_to_1.php">TLR4</a>&#41; works, I don&#39;t want to use whole bacteria - they have a ton of different molecules that might activate tons of different receptors, and I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell what TLR4 itself was doing.</p>
<p>So instead I use purified lipo-poly saccharide &#40;LPS&#41;, which is a molecule that uniquely activates TLR4 &#40;also called a &#40;ligand&quot;&#41;. But when scientists first started using these ligands, they noticed something weird. If they measured what the cells secreted, they found TNF and IL-6, but no IL-1. When they looked inside the cells, on the other hand, there was plenty of IL-1. So there was no problem with the production of IL-1, it just wasn&#39;t getting out of the cell.</p>
<p>This is where I need to talk about caspases. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase">Caspases</a> are a large family of proteases - which means they cut other proteins. Some proteases are fairly non-specific, they&#39;ll chew up lots of different proteins at lots of different places. Caspases are much more specific; they are very particular about what proteins they cut, and where those cuts are made. It turns out that when IL-1 is made, it&#39;s made in a immature form called pro-IL-1 that can&#39;t be secreted until it&#39;s cleaved in half by caspase-1. Once this happens, IL-1 can make its way out of the cell and do its thing. But there&#39;s always some caspase-1 in the cell, so why isn&#39;t pro-IL-1 cleaved immediately?</p>
<p>In general, caspases do very dangerous things. Inflammation triggered by IL-1 can be very destructive, so it needs to be kept in check &#40;more on that later&#41;, and other caspases are involved in the signaling cascade that causes cell suicide &#40;apoptosis&#41;. This means that caspases need to be tightly regulated, so caspases are first made in an inactive form: pro-caspase. Just like IL-1, in order to be fully active, a caspase must be cut by another protease &#40;usually another caspase&#41;.  This is where the inflammasome comes in. It&#39;s just a fancy name given to a large complex of proteins whose function is to activate caspase-1 and allow inflammation. Inflammasome assembly is initiated by a pattern recognition receptor &#40;PRR&#41; binding to its ligand. This allows the PRR to recruit a protein called ASC, which then recruits a bunch of pro-caspase-1 molecules, forming a wheel-like structure &#40;where caspase-1 forms the spokes&#41;. When a lot of caspase-1 is forced into close proximity by the inflammasome, they are able to cleave each other, activating the whole complex &#40;as soon as one gets cleaved and activated, it will immediately cleave and activate all of its neighbors&#41;. Once the complex is activated, it can go on to cleave any pro-IL-1 in the cell, and allow it to be secreted. </p>
<p>&#91;Adapted from <a href="http://www.nature.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/nri/journal/v8/n5/fig_tab/nri2296_F2.html">doi:10.1038/nri2296</a>&#93;</p>
<p>TL;DR version: PRR assembles inflammasome –&gt; inflammasome activates caspase-1 –&gt; caspase-1 activates IL-1 –&gt; IL-1 gets secreted.</p>
<p>You may be wondering, &quot;why is any of this necessary?&quot; It&#39;s hard to definitively answer &quot;why&quot; questions in biology, but one idea is the danger hypothesis. Our bodies are swarming with bacteria, fungi and viruses, but most of them won&#39;t end up doing any harm. The pattern-recognition receptors of the innate immune system can&#39;t distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys. The inflammasome is triggered by signals of danger &#40;DNA in the cytoplasm and membrane damage for instance&#41;, so if a cell sees a bacteria, and there&#39;s some signal that something is wrong, you want to induce inflammation, but if there&#39;s only bacteria, but no danger, or there&#39;s danger but no pathogen, inflammation can be destructive.</p>
<p>The inflammasome was only discovered in 2002, so there&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s a fascinating and complex field. Take a look at that first paragraph and see if it makes sense now. If it still doesn&#39;t, please let me know, I&#39;m still working on how to explain complex topics like this. Too much detail? Too little?</p>
