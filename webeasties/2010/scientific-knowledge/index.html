<p><em>This post initially appeared on <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties">Science Blogs</a></em></p>
<p>The &quot;Science and the Public&quot; story of the year might just be Arsenic using bacteria. Certainly, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2010/12/guest_post_arsenate-based_dna.php">Alex&#39;s critique</a> has been the most popular post on this blog since we started and has received quite a bit of attention from other bloggers as well as in <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2276919/">conventional</a> <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2010/12/08/claims-of-a-new-life-form-get-whacked.html">media.</a>  This might be a teachable moment in science communication, but even though it&#39;s clear that this wasn&#39;t handled particularly well, it&#39;s hard to see how things can be done better in the future. Heather&#39;s <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2010/12/if_you_read_alex_bradleys.php">follow-up post </a>is a great summary of how science works in the real world, but I think it also illustrates a fundamental difference in how science goes about collecting knowledge compared to most people in their daily lives, and especially compared to how the media reports what is &quot;news.&quot;</p>
<p>Consider Heather&#39;s first steps in the scientific process:</p>
<p>Scientist thinks they have made major new discovery</p>
<p>Scientists writes up said discovery and submits paper to peer-reviewed journal &#40;the bigger the claim, the fancier the journal&#41;</p>
<p>If editors of journal like the paper, they send it off to 3 or so experts in the field who review it, and provide the editor with feedback as to whether they feel the work is valid or not.</p>
<p>Eventually, lets say the paper makes its way through the reviewers and gets published.</p>
<p>Advancing science is a formal process, and it&#39;s collaborative. In principal, it doesn&#39;t fall sway to arguments from authority or many of the other fallacies that people often succumb to. Arguments are based on data, and rebuttals use data to refute claims. I think that&#39;s been accurately reflected in this debate: Wolfe-Simon and her colleagues published a paper containing a great deal of data, which they interpreted in a particular way. Most of the criticism has focused on the data, their methods for collecting it, or the claims they made based on the data. As a scientist, attacks on your data can feel like personal attacks, and sometimes debates like this can get quite heated, but the currency is almost always the data itself.</p>
<p>As I said, this is how it works in principal, but scientists are human too. In reality, an established lab with lots of credibility will have an easier time publishing sketchy data than a freshly minted assistant professor, and people will look more critically at a paper that&#39;s published by a fierce competitor, but in general, over time, these biases work themselves out. The critical piece is the process that happens after a paper is published:</p>
<p>other scientists start to pick at the paper &#40;again, the bigger the claim, the more criticism typically surfaces&#41;.</p>
<p>Original author might perform additional experiments that address these claims.</p>
<p>Other scientists might carry out experiments that disprove the claims.</p>
<p>Original claim either does, or does not, stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, media rarely reports this part of the story. It&#39;s no wonder really; it can take decades for a consensus to be reached. Science advances incrementally, in fits and starts, and the really fundamental breakthroughs often aren&#39;t appreciated until years later. But this process is the key to the success of science: the process acknowledges the propensity for error. And because of that, we get <a href="http://chem.tufts.edu/answersinscience/relativityofwrong.htm">incrementally closer</a> to the right answer.</p>
<p>There&#39;s more to say on this, but I wanted to throw this out and get some feed back. Do you think that there&#39;s a way for science or science reporting to make this long slog interesting, or to make it seem like a good thing? In most other contexts, constantly getting things wrong would be seen as a bad thing, but I think it&#39;s the greatest strength of science.</p>
