<p><em>This post initially appeared on <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties">Science Blogs</a></em></p>
<p>Our immune system needs to be on a hair-trigger. When you breathe in a virus or a bacterium enters a cut on your arm, you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1">don&#39;t want</a> to mess around:</p>
<p>&#40;disclaimer: most of what George Carlin says in the rest of that clip is not supported by the science &#40;though it&#39;s funny as hell&#41;&#41;</p>
<p>But all of that heavy immunological artillery is dangerous, and when it&#39;s directed at the wrong target, there can be a lot of collateral damage. Some of the most important parts of the immune system are mechanisms of tolerance - teaching the immune system to ignore the things that aren&#39;t a threat. For the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2010/11/immune_response_from_start_to_1.php">innate immune system</a>, tolerance is hard-wired. The receptors that signal danger have evolved over hundreds of millions of years to only detect conserved pattern that are present on potential pathogens.</p>
<p>For the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2010/11/immune_response_from_start_to_2.php">adaptive immune system</a>, it&#39;s a different story. T-cells and B-cells generate their receptors at random, and have the potential to recognize an effectively infinite number of targets. From birth, these cellular assassins have a single, specific target, and the means to do significant damage to it. But if that target is, say, insulin, you don&#39;t want that assassin making it out onto the street. So, during development, T-cells and B-cells undergo an elaborate education process in which cells that react against any self targets are forced to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis">commit suicide</a>, taking their potentially damaging targeting system with them. But this &quot;central tolerance&quot; mechanism is only half of the story.  As anyone with allergies can tell you, having an immune system that attacks harmless targets can be <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2011/03/question_for_the_hivemind_alle.php">miserable</a>, or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis">deadly</a>. Foreign, but benign molecules are not present where T- and B-cells develop, so central tolerance isn&#39;t enough. There is no place where this problem is more apparent than in the gut, which has to deal with trillions of non-harmful bacteria, as well as foreign molecules in the form of food. As a result, there are a plethora of so-called &quot;peripheral tolerance&quot; mechanisms at play in the gut. One of these is a special type of T-cell called a regulatory T-cell &#40;or Treg&#41; that, rather than activating the immune system, actually suppresses it.</p>
<p>The environment of the gut is known to induce Treg&#39;s, and it was recently discovered that retinoic acid - one of the products of vitamin A metabolism - was partly responsible. To immunologists, this made a lot of conceptual sense. It&#39;s still not exactly clear how T-cells decide what their fate will be, and it made sense that a dietary factor - something that would only be present in one of the places Treg&#39;s are most needed, would help skew that choice. But before you run out and start and downing VitA supplements to treat your food allergy, consider this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v471/n7337/abstract/nature09849.html">Co-adjuvant effects of retinoic acid and IL-15 induce inflammatory immunity to dietary antigens</a></p>
<p>IL-15 is a cytokine - a type of molecule that the immune system uses to communicate between cells - and it turns out that when IL-15 is around, retinoic acid actually behaves in precisely the opposite way with respect to T-cells. It decreases the number of Treg&#39;s, and increases inflammation. This is an observational study - there&#39;s not a lot of information about how IL-15 behavior causes this change. The authors chose to look at this because it&#39;s known that patients with celiac disease &#40;an allergy to dietary gluten&#41; have elevated levels of IL-15, but it&#39;s not even clear if it&#39;s the IL-15 that decreases Treg development so that inflammation gets going, or if the inflammation starts for some other reason and the IL-15 just makes it worse.  The major implication here is that the folks hoping to use VitA to help calm down the gut immune system are probably out of luck - that could make the situation even worse.</p>

<p>Extras</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It turns out the experiment of therapeutic retinoids increasing inflammation in the gut might have already been tested <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16863562">on accident</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bonus conclusion &#40;with no data&#41; - the authors threw this gem into the discussion section:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely, these findings provide an explanation as to why children suffering from vitamin A deficiency in developing countries respond less efficiently to oral vaccines than children from developed countries, and also indicate that engineering mucosal vaccines that induce IL-15 may be beneficial&#91;...&#93;</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to see some follow-up on that.</p>
