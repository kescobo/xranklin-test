<p><em>This post initially appeared on <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties">Science Blogs</a></em></p>
<p>While researching <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2011/07/allergic_to_spunk.php">Wednesday&#39;s post</a>, I ran into a number of strange case studies. They didn&#39;t quite fit into that post, but I thought they were too interesting to ignore. If you&#39;re interested, follow me down the pubmed rabbit hole.</p>
<p>When I typed &quot;semen allergy&quot; into google scholar last week, the very first hit was this paper &#91;We report the case of a 20-year-old woman with documented Brazil nut allergy who developed widespread &#91;hives&#93; and mild &#91;shortness of breath&#93; after intercourse with her boyfriend who had earlier consumed Brazil nuts. Skin prick testing with the boyfriend&#39;s semen after Brazil nut consumption conï¬rmed signiï¬cant reactivity whereas a sample before nut consumption was negative.</p>
<p>The abstract sort of says it all: woman has known allergy, boyfriend eats allergen, they have sex and girl has allergic reaction. For the uninitiated, the skin-prick testing thing might seem a bit weird - they got samples from the boyfriend before and after he ate brazil nuts &#40;masturbation for science&#33;&#41; and injected them under the girlfriend&#39;s skin - but this is a standard allergy test. Allergists already do this with bread mold and ground up dust mites, so I guess semen should be any stranger, but I still raised an eyebrow. If there&#39;s an allergic reaction, after thirty minutes or so, the area around the skin prick will develop a characteristic &quot;wheal and flare,&quot; which is a raised lump at the site of the prick &#40;the wheal&#41; and a reddish circle of inflammation surrounding it &#40;the flare&#41;.  If you have an allergy, but you don&#39;t know the cause, allergists will draw a grid on your back and inject a standard battery of allergens. I know from experience that this is an unpleasant procedure, especially when they don&#39;t find anything and decide that the shallow pricks on the back weren&#39;t enough, so they opt to inject a few other allergens deeper in your shoulder... but I digress.</p>
<p>&#40;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/allspaw/93786866/">Source</a>, flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/allspaw/with/93786866/">jspar</a>&#41;</p>
<p>These doctors found that the woman responded to her boyfriends semen after he had eaten brazil nuts.</p>
<p>&#40;From the paper&#41;</p>
<p>Seems a bit like cheating the way the light is positioned, and I think I can see a bit of a wheal on the left side, but they claim:</p>
<p>We believe this to be the ï¬rst case of a sexually transmitted allergic reaction.</p>
<p>That was published in 2007.</p>
<p>But then I found this other paper from 1986:</p>
<p>A woman complained of severe itching and flushing after sexual intercourse or other physical contact with her husband. She developed a weal and flare on intradermal &#91;under the skin&#93; testing with her husband&#39;s semen and sweat, pooled donor semen and the sweat from her 2 sons.</p>
<p>This poor woman. I&#39;d like to quote the paper at length, but the pdf I have is a scanned copy and I can&#39;t copy paste, so I&#39;ll summarize. Woman is literally allergic to her husband - if she puts her face on a pillow that he&#39;s slept on, she breaks out into hives. When they do a skin-prick test with his semen, she goes into anaphylaxis - nausea, dizziness, sweating and increased heart rate.  She also has a known allergy to a bunch of green/yellow vegetables, which she avoids, but her husband eats in copious quantities. They suspect that he might be transferring dietary allergens in his semen because &#40;and here&#39;s why the 2007 paper above is full of crap&#41; of a paper from 1978 in which a woman who has an allergy to walnuts has an allergic reaction to her husband&#39;s semen after he&#39;s eaten walnuts, but not before. Sound familiar? I can&#39;t seem to find said paper online, but they also apparently went so far as to search for &#40;and find&#41; walnut proteins in the husband&#39;s semen.</p>
<p>Back to the vegetable allergy woman though: In addition to the husband&#39;s semen, they also tested his sweat, sweat from her two sons &#40;one of whom ate the vegetables she was allergic to and one that did not&#41;, and semen pooled from a number of anonymous donors, and she had reactions to all of them &#40;though, interestingly - her reaction to the pooled donor-semen was not as severe&#41;. She also had reactions to ground up hair from her husband &#40;but not her sons&#41; caused a reaction. They stopped short of testing her son&#39;s semen - I guess they&#39;d reached the limits of propriety with the random strangers.</p>
<p>These doctors were clearly having a great time testing everything they could think of but, and I&#39;ll take the time to transcribe this because it&#39;s awesome:</p>
<p>This mysterious case obviously needed further testing&#91;...&#93; However, she solved her problem, at least temporarily, by leaving her husband&#33; She did not wish to return for further testing.</p>
<p>That is one of few exclamation points I&#39;ve ever seen in academic literature. I also image a frowny-face emoticon belongs at the end of the last sentence.</p>
<p>The doctors conclude that it&#39;s probably not a dietary antigen, because she&#39;s allergic to the pooled donor semen and because she&#39;s allergic to sweat from both sons, one of whom doesn&#39;t eat the vegetables that she&#39;s known to be allergic to. But this woman is allergic to A LOT of stuff, and it seems to me that the sweat thing may be unrelated. And because of the fact that the reaction to her husband&#39;s semen was stronger than to that of the donors, and we don&#39;t know the diets of the donors, I don&#39;t think anything can be ruled out.</p>
<p>These guys claim to have the first published example of allergy to sweat &#40;and possibly hair&#41;, but after the irrational exuberance of that 2007 paper, I feel like I don&#39;t know who to trust. It seems pretty clear that you can transmit dietary allergens in semen, and maybe other secretions as well? <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2011/07/allergic_to_spunk.php#comment-4621342">A commenter on my last post</a> mentioned that she&#40;?&#41; and her partner have to avoid foods that the other is allergic to because they can transmit allergies between each other. To Elburto - get thee to an allergist, and you too could be immortalized on pubmed.</p>
