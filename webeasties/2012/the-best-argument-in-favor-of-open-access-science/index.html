<p><em>This post initially appeared on <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties">Science Blogs</a></em></p>
<p>While going back through blog archives <a href="http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2011/06/open-access-and-taxes.html?showComment&#61;1308753104679#c8058223782025394800">and</a> reviewing incoming links, I stumbled on <a href="http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2011/06/open-access-and-taxes.html">this post</a> from about a year ago from Zen Faulkes at <a href="http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/">Neuro Dojo</a>:</p>
<p>There are many reasons to argue for open access of scientific research. But this is not the best one:</p>
<p>It’s your taxes that fund the research, you should have access to the results without me or anyone else being a mediator.</p>
<p><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2011/06/science_publishers_dont_care_a.php">That one</a> is from Kevin at We, Beasties. When I <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2011/06/science_publishers_dont_care_a.php#comment-4188045">protested</a> that this argument omits <a href="http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2010/12/indie-spirit.html">indie science</a>, Kevin <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2011/06/science_publishers_dont_care_a.php#comment-4188268">replied</a> that it’s such a small amount as to be not even worth considering.</p>
<p>I object to this characterization of my argument &#40;I did not say it wasn&#39;t worth considering, I pointed out that as government funding accounts for greater than 90&#37; of all funding, they have by far the largest stick to beat publishers with&#41;, but that quibble is a bit beside the point. There&#39;s an important question here that I think deserves consideration, especially as #OAS gains more traction in public policy debates and in the public consciousness* &#40;which is why I&#39;m dragging up a year-old blog post&#41;. What&#39;s the best way to convince people that it&#39;s the right thing to do?</p>
<p>Zen&#39;s original comment objecting to the &quot;taxes&quot; argument does make some fair points - not all science is government funded and our government isn&#39;t the only one funding it. Instead, he writes that:</p>
<p>Scientific results are a common good that create the greatest benefit when they are shared.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Scientific research operates best when you have sharing and transparency. That, I think, is the best argument for open access policies regardless of who pays for it.</p>
<p>I totally agree that this is a great argument, and <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2012/02/21/the-future-of-science-pub/">I&#39;ve made it too</a></p>
<p>Science benefits when the flow of information is unrestricted and everyone benefits when scientific knowledge advances.</p>
<p>But is this argument better than the taxes argument? There are serious problems with the &quot;public good&quot; argument and the &quot;efficiency&quot; argument as well. If your approach is to convince the government to change its policy, arguing that something is a public good and should therefore be brought into the public sphere is likely to poison your position with half the members of congress. I&#39;m so progressive I&#39;m almost a socialist, so the argument works well for me, but publishing is a business and having the government step in and essentially destroy &#40;or at least radically overhaul&#41; a sector of private industry with new regulation would never fly. And that same group of congress people essentially views &quot;government&quot; and &quot;efficiency&quot; as antonyms.</p>
<p>Is it a better argument to convince other scientists? <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2012/04/24/harvard-libraries-join-the-fig/">I applaud</a> the goal of trying to get more scientists to publish there stuff in open access journals, but I just don&#39;t think that this sort of ground-up effort can work on its own. There are too many institutional barriers to scientists that want to buck the trend - grant money, career advancement and prestige are all tied to publication record, and the most prestigious journals are not open access. Several of my grad school buddies have said that I&#39;m crazy, the system we have is just fine and anyway even if it&#39;s not, there&#39;s no way to change it. For them, the taxes argument is probably a loser, but maybe efficiency and public good will only work for some of them.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what the answer is. Ultimately, I think that moving towards open access and even <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2012/02/21/the-future-of-science-pub/">entirely different models</a> for disseminating scientific information is one of the most important causes in modern science, and I think we should pursue every angle to convince people of its merit.</p>

<li><p>I even heard Leo Laporte bring up academic publishing on the <a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-google/158">most recent episode</a> of This Week in Google &#40;around minute 54&#41;. It was just in passing, but this tells me that the issue is filtering into public consciousness. It would be interesting to know what argument&#40;s&#41; resonate with him.</p>
